Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Fendi. I bridge cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, studying how human cognition and behaviour can drive informed AI systems development and strategic decisions.

**Research Interests**

-   Behavioural Economics

-   Game Theory

-   Cognitive Psychology

-   Decision under Risk and Uncertainty

-   Human-AI Interaction

**Current Focus Areas**

-   AI Impact Assessment

-   Benchmarking

-   Digital Twins

I'm actively seeking opportunities where behavioural insights meet cutting-edge AI to tackle complex strategic challenges. I'm ready to collaborate with forward-thinking individuals who recognize that the future of AI success lies in understanding human behaviour.
