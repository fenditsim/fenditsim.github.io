Just released: A carousel guide for the SCORE Prompt Framework with a practical example!\
\
The SCORE framework with OpenAI's ChatGPT4o I mentioned in my previous posts is now available in an easy-to-digest visual format (special thanks to Ivelina for recommending Gamma to create this resource!). Check it out to transform your interactions with ChatGPT 4o!

The carousel includes a little behavioural design experiment I created while waiting for a delayed train at Euston station recently.\
\
Whether you're a behavioural scientist, marketer, or business strategist, this framework can dramatically improve your interactions and outputs with ChatGPT.\
\
✅ Check it out and let me know what you think!\
✅ How are you structuring your prompts today?\
✅ Share with colleagues who want to level up their AI prompt game!\
