    "text": "“A picture is worth a thousand words” - this ancient wisdom especially rings true to me when visualizing complex geographical data.\n\nI’ve been fascinated by how mapping data can instantly reveal patterns that might take pages of statistics to explain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I created an interactive dashboard that visualized infection cases and vaccination rates across regions in the UK. The stark geographical patterns revealed by these maps could help inform public health responses and resource allocation in real-time. Using my interactive webpage built with R and Shiny, you can select any region in England and Wales (including UK), instantly generate and download the corresponding shapefiles. It’s geographical data at your fingertips!\n\nHere’s a powerful example: mapping breast cancer screening rates for women aged 53-70 across London boroughs in 2022-23 (open data from The London Database). In seconds, we can spot areas with high and low screening uptake - the darker color a borough has, the higher screening uptake, and vice versa. This visual insight enables targeted interventions with experimentation - like sending personalized messages to boroughs where screening rates need improvement. With earlier diagnosis through improved screening uptake, we can enhance patient outcomes and potentially reduce the growing treatment waitlists that are impacting so many lives.\n\nBut this is just the beginning - maps can uncover hidden societal and economic challenges in ways that spreadsheets simply can’t. Whether it’s healthcare access, educational outcomes, or environmental concerns - seeing the data geographically can spark meaningful actions.\n\nI’m excited to share this tool with you all. What patterns would you want to uncover? What data would you map to drive positive change in your community?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Having a personal website is ubiquitous and essential these days for professional use. In this project, I am going to share my experience with, creating a personal website with Quarto and R.\nThis project is suitable for beginners who have a little, no prior experience. A few criteria must be met for a beginner to create a personal website:\n\nEasy to program: markdown preferably\nEasily accessible when programming it\nHaving a few templates to play around with, with the possibility to expand with other programming language for designing website such as html, css and js\n\n\nWhat is Quarto?\nTo begin with, it is better for me to give you a brief introduction of what Quarto is. Essentially, it is an open-source software for creating website, document (including LaTeX) as well as presentation slides. Quarto supports multiple programming languages such as Python, R, Julia and Observable JS. In this project we use Quarto with R, as it is pre-installed inside RStudio!\n\n\nWhy Quarto?\nAdditionally, my general impression with Quarto is easy to learn for beginners! It’s based on rmarkdown - so we might not need to know html and css before publishing a website at all!\n\n\nWhat do we need?\nTo start with, we need the following:\n\nR and RStudio installed\n\nWorking inside R’s environment is super-convenient! For instance, we can store every bit of the website inside a R’s project, which can be stored in a cloud.\nIn fact, we simply take the advantage of R and RStudio, rather than coding with R. Quarto is pre-installed inside RStudio, so we do not need to install it from an official website (which, of course, you can do so if you want)\n\nGithub account created and Git installed\n\nAfter creating a personal website with Quarto, we need a server, or a place to deploy it! Github is, in my opinion, an excellent option for deploying a website. First, it is easy to deploy a site. Secondly, we can upload our code there, and access it anywhere we want, as long as we have the internet! Third, we can deploy as many websites as we want for free - this is tempting!\nHere I do not provide how to create a website with Quarto - Quarto itself has a fantastic and user-friendly documentation to follow!\n\n\nTips\n\nRender on Save\nOn your index.qmd document tab, there is a checkbox called ‘Render on Save’ - tick it and the website will be rendered whenever you save your current progress!\n\n\nInstall Quarto on your device\nThis simplifies our experience when we try to render, preview and publish our website. If we want to render our current progress, we can run the following command in terminal (next to Console tab in RStudio):\nquarto render\nOnce our website is rendered, we can preview it with our default browser by running the command in terminal:\nquarto preview\nApart from rendering and previewing our website, we can publish it via Terminal (see below)!\n\n\nCreating multiple pages\nOf course, we would like to have multiple pages for showcasing different contents, rather than a single page about ourselves in our website! Creating another page within our website by simply adding another quarto document is basic. Yet, this creates a problem in the website address. For example, we create an About page with a quarto document about.qmd. After we click that page in our website, the website address ends with ‘about.html’.\nI was inspired by this lovely website built with Quarto for resolving this issue, we can create a folder called ‘About’, and rename that quarto document from about.qmd to index.qmd (Remember to update the relevant href link inside _quarto.yml, such as about/index.qmd!). The new website address ends with /about/ - looks prettier and more advanced!\n\n\nUploading your site on Github\nAfter creating a personal website with Quarto, we need a server, or a place to deploy it! First, we open Terminal tab inside RStudio. We run the following command to check if RStudio connects to our Github repository properly:\ngit remote show origin\nIf the link shown does not match with our Github repository’s, we can remove it with the following command:\ngit remote remove origin\nThen we add our Github repository’s link, and run the previous command again for a second check.\nFor uploading the website, I’d recommend taking the quarto publish approach. Follow steps on this site if you have not created a gh-pages branch in your Github repository.\nYou might want to update your personal website with new content occasionally. First, make sure you are going to make changes of your website in main branch (it should be the name of your default branch) by running the following command in Terminal:\ngit checkout main\nUpload all your recent changes of your website in R.proj into your github repository (main branch). This ensures your Github repository is up-to-date, and thus you can pick it up with another machine if needed.\nNext, in the Terminal tab (which is next to Console tab), type the following command to update your website:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nR then asks if you’d like to update your personal website, and type ‘Y’. It then automatically ‘publish’ the latest version of your page.\nIt’s alright if you ignore the first step and do the second step only. However, only ‘gh-pages’ branch is then up-to-date (with an automatic committed message like ‘Built site for gh-pages’) - it would be better to make sure your main branch is also up-to-date, too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead this if you create the site for the first time\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you create gh-pages branch in your repository for the first time, go to Settings &gt; Pages &gt; Build and deployment &gt; Branch and select gh-pages as the branch for the site. Otherwise, your page will show 404 error message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s next?\nCongratulations! You’ve created your personal website with Quarto! A few here and there you can customize in your website, such as:\n\nAdding a favicon\nChanging foreground and background color for the navigation bar and body\nAdding a page footer\nModifying html format options\nModifying your resume with Quarto’s built-in templates\nCreating a blog within your website!\n\nHave fun creating your website!"

    "text": "I’ve been experimenting with CrewAI to build a specialized AI agent teams using only open-source LLMs.\n\nInspired by Viktoria Semaan’s Instagram reel about creating a multi-agent team of financial specialists for investment decisions, I took a different approach: while her system relies primarily on proprietary models like Claude from Anthropic, I wanted to explore what happens when we build a multi-agent system using only open-source LLMs - each optimized for specific tasks based on their unique strengths (see below). This approach could be particularly valuable for small to medium-sized businesses looking to deploy AI solutions internally without compromising sensitive data - prioritizing privacy and security (since these models run entirely locally without connecting to the internet).\n\nFor this experiment, I needed a real-world challenge to test my multi-agent system. Ivelina, a full-time content creator who manages over 2.5M followers across multiple social media accounts, suggested an intriguing task for me: creating a Valentine’s Day campaign for an upscale Kensington, London cafe targeting wealthy individuals. I then assembled a crew of my beloved AI agents to tackle this marketing challenge. Each agent was configured with task-specific temperature settings:\n\nDeepSeek-r1 by DeepSeek AI due to its analytical powerhouse with fact-based reasoning\nMistral by Mistral AI due to its balanced analytical-creative capabilities\nPhi4 by Microsoft as it excels at logical reasoning and mathematical precision\nGemma2 by Google as it is great at engaging, conversational content\nLlama3.2 by Meta due to its sophisticated creative ideation\n\nThis ‘division of labor’ (drawing inspiration from Adam Smith’s notion of Division of Labor - a concept I deeply appreciated during my training as an Economist at the Hong Kong Baptist University) allows each agent to contribute its strengths. Meanwhile, as the Decision Maker, I maintain oversight of the final product, which is an executive summary bringing together all perspectives.\n\nThough my initial findings are still preliminary and incomplete, I discovered several significant challenges during this experiment. First, running multiple models locally demands significant computing power. The models also lack access to real-time information, limiting their contextual awareness. Additionally, Shantanu - one of my fellow colleagues conducting research in Strategic Management at the Warwick Business School - aptly pointed out that evaluating individual agent performance within such a system remains complex during our conversation. These challenges present interesting opportunities for future refinement.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with multi-agent systems using open-source models? What configurations have you found most effective?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn this post, I present a bus timetable app (link) for students at the University of Warwick made with Shiny. This Shiny app is for illustration purpose only.\nI extract daily timetable data (which are downloadable) from NX Bus Coventry.\nNote that this bus timetable app does not produce real-time information; it basically illustrate all timeslots in a timetable provided.\nThis bus timetable app only shows timeslots for buses under NX Bus Coventry. It is possible to shows buses from Stagecoach in future updates (if relevant timetable are downloadable publicly).\n\n\nFeatures\nThis bus timetable app has two inputs:\n\nFrom: the starting point\nTo: the destination\n\nThe default option for each of these two inputs are ‘Pool Meadow Bus Station’ and ‘University of Warwick Bus Interchange’ respectively.\nUser can select different starting point (e.g., Coventry Rail Station) with the same destination (‘University of Warwick Bus Interchange’), or different destinations with the same starting point (‘University of Warwick Bus Interchange’).\nUnder these two inputs there are four rows; each row represent a bus and its arrival time, indicated with a color box.\nIf a bus is available, its corresponding color box shows two lines. The first lines shows how many minutes left before it starts from the starting point, while the second line shows its time. User can click into the color box to see the last and upcoming bus arrival times (in terms of time and minutes).\nThere are four possible colors in a color box:\n\nred: less than 5 minutes\nyellow: between 5 and 10 minutes\ngreen: more than 10 minutes\npurple: No information available (shown as NA; ‘Not Applicable’)\n\n\n\nBackground\nThis project is one of the projects I started paying more attention to recently.\nIt started off during a bus strike in Coventry in March 2023. At that time I was very confused about bus arrivals as Apple Maps, Google Maps and the one inside MyWarwick app did not show real-time information whenever buses worked.\nI then went on official sites and found some useful information. Yet, it is not mobile-browser-friendly as table of the timetable did not adjust to a mobile browser size. Also, it could be frustrating to scroll through the table, when what I really wanted to know from it is when the upcoming bus arrival would be!\nI had an idea of building a bus timetable app with Shiny during Christmas last year. I could not pay a lot of attention due to major issues in my professional and personal lives.\nRecently I picked up from where I left of eight months ago, and started working it extensively. I encountered a number of challenges both in front-end (such as the layout and design) and back-end (how to match with the current time) etc. As for the front-end, I took the traffic light approach - it’s straightforward, and commonly known among us - red is ‘danger’, yellow is ‘mild’ and green is ‘alright’. As for the back-end, it is, in fact, fascinating to learn how to deploy a shiny app that automatically refreshes after a certain time, how to update one input conditionally on another input etc.\nDespite all the challenges I encountered while coding it, I am truly grateful it works the way I envisioned a year ago!\nMost importantly, I hope it ultimately benefits UoW students who commute daily by buses. After staying here for more than six years, I truly understand the frustration when asking ‘when the bus will be here soon?!’.\nIt reminds me of one time I was waiting for 12x (an express bus between university and city centre) with a group of my friends at night in January (very cold!). One of my friends asked if we should wait for 12x though there was 11 (a bus with way more stops than 12x).\nWe started to view it as a decision-making problem - ‘a bet’ between a certain option with 11 (albeit taking more time) or an uncertain option with 12x (who knows when exactly it would arrive at night?).\nI do not remember which option we chose anyway. At that time, of course, it would be way better if we did have an app that shows bus arrival!\nMyWarwick app has a feature of showing bus arrivals time, but it seems to restrict on showing arrivals in some stops. Other alternatives such as Apple Maps and Google Maps work well. Recently I noticed that we can use CityMapper for checking bus arrival - an app I would recommend using as it works in other big cities in UK such as London (can’t live without it as it shows how much a trip would cost for alternatives), Birmingham and Manchester.\nIn the end, I am glad that I’ve made this app the way I envisioned! This bus timetable app is similar to a group of people back home creating a mobile app that shows real-time bus arrival. Honestly, theirs is way more advanced than mine!"

    "text": "“An experimental investigation of virtual bargaining in one-shot and repeated games” (2024) [link]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this thesis, I aim to explain the existence of coordination without communication, a striking finding in studying interactive decision making in non-cooperative interactions. I apply, and test, Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB), a recent theory of psychological commitment whereby agents choose based on tacit agreements formed via hypothetical negotiations.\nThe first part of this thesis investigates coordination in an adversarial, one-off interaction between an employer and a worker called the Inspection Game.\nChapter 2 investigates how varying inspection cost affects likelihood of noncompliance detection. When inspection is at substantially higher costs, Nash reasoning predicts no inspection, while VB predicts inspection is still possible, even when it is very costly to do so. We also investigate whether social norm might instead be potential cause to our finding and find no support for this hypothesis.\nExtending the theory of VB, Chapter 3 discusses theoretically how an appearance of a bargaining procedure in an interaction, such as nonbinding, costless agreements, creates an asymmetry in bargaining power among agents, and thus often facilitates coordination. We discuss how this new approach to VB can be applied into other social interactions, helping to explain why unilateral, instead of bilateral, communication can lead to more coordination in an interaction.\nChapter 4 explores noncompliance prevention with unilateral, costless communication in the Inspection Game. We apply theoretical discussion from Chapter 3 with other psychological theories that explain sender’s promise-keeping behavior. We find that the effectiveness of unilateral communication for preventing noncompliance depends on who the sender in an employer-worker relationship is.\nThe second part of this thesis emphasizes on coordination in a dyadic, repeated interaction whereby “taking turns” is mutually beneficial. Chapter 5 explores reciprocation in the Alternation Game. This chapter also discusses other theories that explain pro-sociality in social interactions as potential drivers of reciprocation in this context.\n\nIndividual Chapters:\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nChapter 2: How does Inspection Cost affect choices in the Inspection Game?\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn an employer-worker relationship, an employer deploys an inspection, albeit costly to her, to detect, and discourage noncompliance behavior from her worker. It is natural to assume that the cost of paying to inspect has an impact on both roles. A well-developed approach in game theory, Nash reasoning, predicts that noncompliance cannot be discouraged entirely as both randomize their own choices for their own interests. Nash reasoning predicts that an employer is better off letting go of inspection once it becomes costlier than paying for worker’s wage. We posit our investigation of inspection cost in the Inspection Game, which models an adversarial interaction between an employer and her worker. We apply Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB) that show worker’s non-compliance can be discouraged entirely, inspection can still be an effective deterrence when it becomes costlier, and when inspection loses its effectiveness entirely. We conduct two experiments with online participants: a choice experiment with three different inspection costs (Low, Medium and High) in which Nash reasoning and VB have the same predictions in Low and High conditions, but they diverge in the Medium condition; a norm elicitation experiment that explores the underlying norm by eliciting socially appropriate ratings of each action in our choice experiment. Surprisingly, our choice experiment reports that worker’s shirking probability does not vary across three conditions, and there is a negative association between inspection cost and employer’s inspecting probability. Interestingly, inspecting probability does not drop to zero in both Medium and High conditions, as Nash reasoning predicts. Our norm elicitation experiment reports that inspection and working are the most socially appropriate actions for both roles in most conditions, yet this cannot explain behaviors well in the choice experiment.\n\nChapter 3: Virtual Bargaining with Asymmetric Bargaining Power\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe often see social interactions that multiple equilibria agents could coordinate on, and usually decision theories like Nash reasoning and Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB) cannot provide a unique solution. A ‘refinement’ in selecting an equilibrium is necessary. A simple way for such refinement is to posit an interaction, as VB posits, as a bargaining situation among agents, and implement a procedure such as pre-play communication before they make a choice. This chapter proposes VB with Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Solution (henceforth ‘VB-ANBS’), a new approach of VB in attempting resolving coordination issues in interactions whereby a bargaining procedure is incremented in an interaction. VB-ANBS assumes that when a bargaining procedure is incremented, an agent’s bargaining power can be viewed as a confrontation between two types of psychological forces in social psychology: an agent’s ‘inducing’ force on the other agent, and a ‘resisting’ force of an agent when receiving an inducing force from others. An agent’s bargaining power is defined as the relative strength of her force in totality of forces acting on a given interaction at a given time. A’s bargaining power is then calculated as a ratio between her inducing force on B’s action and the sum of forces (her inducing force and B’s resisting force) in their interaction. This theoretical discussion first posits dyadic two-stage interactions whereby pre-play communication is present. VB-ANBS illustrates how a virtual bargain is in an interaction is influenced by the presence of a procedural asymmetry, for instance, how coordination can be achieved in mixed-motive games, how the ability to communicate in advance influences whether a potential threat can be implemented or avoided in a social interaction. Also, VB-ANBS provides insights as to why a bilateral communication, or unlimited conversation between a pair, might not lead to a virtual bargain in a context whereby their interests are not well-aligned. As power is relational among agents in a bargaining situation, VB-ANBS can explain differences in two common types of leadership (authoritarian and democratic), why the effect of a public announcement diminishes with group size as well as power distance, in terms of bargaining power.\n\nChapter 4: Communication as Noncompliance Prevention in the Inspection Game\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn our daily lives, non-binding, costless statements are ubiquitous as an effective coordination device. In an employer-worker relationship, could such statements be an effective tool for an employer to prevent from, and thus discourage, noncompliance behavior from her worker? In this study, we posit our investigation on such adversarial interaction as the Inspection Game and discuss whether and how one-way communication can be an effective tool for noncompliance prevention. We apply three theories that explains why a sender keeps her promises: due to tacit agreements in an interaction when a bargaining procedure is present (VB with Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Solution), an aversion of anticipating that her recipient is let down when a promise is not kept (Guilt Aversion) and an aversion of a psychological cost when an inconsistency occurs between a promise and an action (Lying Aversion). We conduct an experiment with online participants: an Inspection Game with three different inspection costs (Low, Medium, and High) and two directions of communication (Downward and Upward) that theories have different predictions. Our study reports that talk is not ‘cheap’, and the direction of communication matters. Both employer and worker exploit the advantage of pre-play communication for personal interests. Interestingly, recipients behave differently from the prediction of a standard theoretical reasoning. We also explore the meaning of messages with a classification (promise, statement of intent, and empty talk), and show that most senders exploit fully the ability to send a pre-play promise or a statement of intent, and their recipients make a choice according to their messages.

    "text": "“An experimental investigation of virtual bargaining in one-shot and repeated games” (2024) [link]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this thesis, I aim to explain the existence of coordination without communication, a striking finding in studying interactive decision making in non-cooperative interactions. I apply, and test, Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB), a recent theory of psychological commitment whereby agents choose based on tacit agreements formed via hypothetical negotiations.\nThe first part of this thesis investigates coordination in an adversarial, one-off interaction between an employer and a worker called the Inspection Game.\nChapter 2 investigates how varying inspection cost affects likelihood of noncompliance detection. When inspection is at substantially higher costs, Nash reasoning predicts no inspection, while VB predicts inspection is still possible, even when it is very costly to do so. We also investigate whether social norm might instead be potential cause to our finding and find no support for this hypothesis.\nExtending the theory of VB, Chapter 3 discusses theoretically how an appearance of a bargaining procedure in an interaction, such as nonbinding, costless agreements, creates an asymmetry in bargaining power among agents, and thus often facilitates coordination. We discuss how this new approach to VB can be applied into other social interactions, helping to explain why unilateral, instead of bilateral, communication can lead to more coordination in an interaction.\nChapter 4 explores noncompliance prevention with unilateral, costless communication in the Inspection Game. We apply theoretical discussion from Chapter 3 with other psychological theories that explain sender’s promise-keeping behavior. We find that the effectiveness of unilateral communication for preventing noncompliance depends on who the sender in an employer-worker relationship is.\nThe second part of this thesis emphasizes on coordination in a dyadic, repeated interaction whereby “taking turns” is mutually beneficial. Chapter 5 explores reciprocation in the Alternation Game. This chapter also discusses other theories that explain pro-sociality in social interactions as potential drivers of reciprocation in this context.\n\nIndividual Chapters:\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nChapter 2: How does Inspection Cost affect choices in the Inspection Game?\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn an employer-worker relationship, an employer deploys an inspection, albeit costly to her, to detect, and discourage noncompliance behavior from her worker. It is natural to assume that the cost of paying to inspect has an impact on both roles. A well-developed approach in game theory, Nash reasoning, predicts that noncompliance cannot be discouraged entirely as both randomize their own choices for their own interests. Nash reasoning predicts that an employer is better off letting go of inspection once it becomes costlier than paying for worker’s wage. We posit our investigation of inspection cost in the Inspection Game, which models an adversarial interaction between an employer and her worker. We apply Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB) that show worker’s non-compliance can be discouraged entirely, inspection can still be an effective deterrence when it becomes costlier, and when inspection loses its effectiveness entirely. We conduct two experiments with online participants: a choice experiment with three different inspection costs (Low, Medium and High) in which Nash reasoning and VB have the same predictions in Low and High conditions, but they diverge in the Medium condition; a norm elicitation experiment that explores the underlying norm by eliciting socially appropriate ratings of each action in our choice experiment. Surprisingly, our choice experiment reports that worker’s shirking probability does not vary across three conditions, and there is a negative association between inspection cost and employer’s inspecting probability. Interestingly, inspecting probability does not drop to zero in both Medium and High conditions, as Nash reasoning predicts. Our norm elicitation experiment reports that inspection and working are the most socially appropriate actions for both roles in most conditions, yet this cannot explain behaviors well in the choice experiment.\n\nChapter 3: Virtual Bargaining with Asymmetric Bargaining Power\n\n\nAbstract\n\nWe often see social interactions that multiple equilibria agents could coordinate on, and usually decision theories like Nash reasoning and Virtual Bargaining (henceforth VB) cannot provide a unique solution. A ‘refinement’ in selecting an equilibrium is necessary. A simple way for such refinement is to posit an interaction, as VB posits, as a bargaining situation among agents, and implement a procedure such as pre-play communication before they make a choice. This chapter proposes VB with Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Solution (henceforth ‘VB-ANBS’), a new approach of VB in attempting resolving coordination issues in interactions whereby a bargaining procedure is incremented in an interaction. VB-ANBS assumes that when a bargaining procedure is incremented, an agent’s bargaining power can be viewed as a confrontation between two types of psychological forces in social psychology: an agent’s ‘inducing’ force on the other agent, and a ‘resisting’ force of an agent when receiving an inducing force from others. An agent’s bargaining power is defined as the relative strength of her force in totality of forces acting on a given interaction at a given time. A’s bargaining power is then calculated as a ratio between her inducing force on B’s action and the sum of forces (her inducing force and B’s resisting force) in their interaction. This theoretical discussion first posits dyadic two-stage interactions whereby pre-play communication is present. VB-ANBS illustrates how a virtual bargain is in an interaction is influenced by the presence of a procedural asymmetry, for instance, how coordination can be achieved in mixed-motive games, how the ability to communicate in advance influences whether a potential threat can be implemented or avoided in a social interaction. Also, VB-ANBS provides insights as to why a bilateral communication, or unlimited conversation between a pair, might not lead to a virtual bargain in a context whereby their interests are not well-aligned. As power is relational among agents in a bargaining situation, VB-ANBS can explain differences in two common types of leadership (authoritarian and democratic), why the effect of a public announcement diminishes with group size as well as power distance, in terms of bargaining power.\n\nChapter 4: Communication as Noncompliance Prevention in the Inspection Game\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn our daily lives, non-binding, costless statements are ubiquitous as an effective coordination device. In an employer-worker relationship, could such statements be an effective tool for an employer to prevent from, and thus discourage, noncompliance behavior from her worker? In this study, we posit our investigation on such adversarial interaction as the Inspection Game and discuss whether and how one-way communication can be an effective tool for noncompliance prevention. We apply three theories that explains why a sender keeps her promises: due to tacit agreements in an interaction when a bargaining procedure is present (VB with Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Solution), an aversion of anticipating that her recipient is let down when a promise is not kept (Guilt Aversion) and an aversion of a psychological cost when an inconsistency occurs between a promise and an action (Lying Aversion). We conduct an experiment with online participants: an Inspection Game with three different inspection costs (Low, Medium, and High) and two directions of communication (Downward and Upward) that theories have different predictions. Our study reports that talk is not ‘cheap’, and the direction of communication matters. Both employer and worker exploit the advantage of pre-play communication for personal interests. Interestingly, recipients behave differently from the prediction of a standard theoretical reasoning. We also explore the meaning of messages with a classification (promise, statement of intent, and empty talk), and show that most senders exploit fully the ability to send a pre-play promise or a statement of intent, and their recipients make a choice according to their messages. We conclude that one-way communication, depending on who can send a pre-play message in an employer-worker relationship, can be an effective tool for noncompliance prevention.\n\nChapter 5: Exploring Reciprocation in the Alternation Game\n\n\nAbstract\n\nReciprocity, as a form of coordination, is ubiquitous in social interactions. However, what does reciprocal behavior look like, and most importantly, why does reciprocal behavior exist in a non-cooperative, repeated interaction? We explore reciprocal behaviors in the Alternation Game (henceforth ‘AG’), a variant of the finitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma that a pair can be mutually beneficial by engaging in turn-taking behavior as a reciprocal behavior. Nash reasoning conjectures that reciprocation is impossible in the finitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma and AG, while a vast body of experimental studies contradicts this.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn this post, I present a personal spending dashboard (link) that helps visualize and analyse monthly spending. This Shiny app is for illustration purpose only.\n\n\nFeatures\nThis spending dashboard allows user to upload a csv file with specific format (for more information, see the Home tab in the dashboard). User is required to provide spending of the past 12 months and current month.\nThis dashboard also provides you valuable information about your spending, such as:\n\nHow does your current month’s spending look like? (distribution)\nHow does your yearly spending trend look like? (trend)\nDoes your spending pattern in current month differ from that of average of last 12 months’? (overall comparison)\nFor each spending category, how does your current month’s improve from average of last 12 months’? (per-category comparison)\n\n\n\nBackground\nI had a habit of keeping track of my monthly expenses since I moved to UK. Thankfully, my bank’s mobile app categorized my spending each month, which provides some insights on the distribution of my monthly spending.\nYet, I wondered if I could visualize and analyse how spending in each category varies over time, particularly over the last 12 months or so.\nAlso, it would be better to have a comparison in spending between current month and a reference group - which the average spending of the last 12 months (self-referencing) seems to do a pretty good job.\nWith a bit of techniques from Behavioural Science and some questions about monthly spending, I managed to create a draft of this dashboard. I was fortunate to have my friends (Junning and Shantanu) who provided valuable insights in terms of the layout and possibility of how this dashboard could be in the future!\nWith this spending dashboard, I have a few questions about managing personal spending:\n\nHow do users react to absolute amounts vs. percentage changes in spending?\nIt seems to me that these two might produce different results in the overspending and saving up sections (framing effect). The absolute amount would be a more effective tool than percentage changes when alerting how much a user overspent (in a ‘loss’ framing), simply because the latter would require a user to (i) be aware of what the original spending that is compared to, and (ii) perform a mathematical calculation with the information.\nCan this dashboard improve financial literacy?\nThe aim of this dashboard is to provide simple, valuable insights on managing personal spending. Thus, it would be interesting to conduct a within-participant experiment, which is to measure a user’s financial literacy before and after using the dashboard for a period. For instance, we could elicit how well user manages their personal spending with a set of questions before they use this dashboard. We could inform them to use this dashboard weekly, bi-monthly, monthly with reminders. After a period (e.g., three months), we ask them the same set of questions and observe if there are any differences in response.\nWhich is more effective for encouraging savings: personal or community reference points?\nIn this dashboard, I applied self-referencing in the comparison (current month’s spending with average monthly spending of the 12 last months). One of the prevalent effect in reference-point literature is to comparing it with a community (e.g., you used 50% energy more than what your neighbours used in the last month in nudging energy-saving). To create such community-referencing effect, bank could make use of users’ spending (in anonymous way) to nudge for personal spending. Yet, it seems to me that it would be better and beneficial for banks if users could also be nudged to invest more, with the money they could save up from this."
